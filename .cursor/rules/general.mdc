# Project Rules

To get brief context on each file, you can reference [files.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/files.mdc) (the journal), which provides brief descriptions on the overall purpose of the file,
its layout, functions in the file, purposes, etc. in a bulleted-form.

## Making Changes

When you make a change to a file, you need to rewrite the context of the file in its appropriate section in [files.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/files.mdc).
Expect the format to be like so:

  ```md
  ## <directory>/<file-name>.<ext>

  - Purpose: <purpose-of-file>
  - Context:
    - Functions/Layout:
      - <brief-excerpt-on-info-you-want-to-save>
      - <name>(<params>)
        <Purpose-and-what-it-returns>
      ...
  ```
